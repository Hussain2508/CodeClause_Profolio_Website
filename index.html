        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Hussain Khan, but you may also know me as Ghost. I am currently pursuing Information Technology at
          NSAKCET and I am extremely passionate about becoming a UI/UX developer. 

         One of my biggest hobbies is sketching and exploring various designs. I find immense joy in bringing my creative ideas to life through visual mediums. It allows me to express myself and explore new avenues of design.

         In addition to my design interests, I have also established a significant online presence. I am proud to say that I have successfully built a community of 440 subscribers on Telegram. Through this platform, I share valuable B.E OU (Bachelor of Engineering, Osmania University) notes for every branch. The name of my Telegram channel is AceYourStudies-O.U(B.E).
         My goal with this channel is to provide support and resources to students who are pursuing engineering at Osmania University. I believe that access to quality educational materials can make a significant difference in one's academic journey, and I am dedicated to helping others succeed in their studies.

        I am always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for design and learning. If you have any questions, need assistance with UI/UX development, or simply want to chat about design, feel free to reach out to me. Let's embark on this creative journey together!</p>
